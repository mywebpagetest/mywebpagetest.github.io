Hello, and welcome to my website!

I am a fourth year PhD student in Economics at the University of Texas at Austin. My primary areas of interest are macroeconomics and labor economics. 

My current research focuses on understanding the consequences of firm market power on labor market outcomes in a search theoretic framework.

For more information please contact me at: **<sbagga@utexas.edu>**

* **Firm Market Power, Worker Mobility, and Wages in the US Labor Market** ([**Slides**](/file/bagga_slides_public.pdf))

Abstract: 
A recent body of literature has documented evidence of increasing employer market power in the US. I develop an equilibrium model of the labor market to explain its effect on aggregate outcomes such as wage growth and job-to-job transitions. The model has two main ingredients: (i) there exists a finite number of employers that differ in productivity, and (ii) employers exert market power by excluding their vacancies from the set of outside offers faced by their employees. The combined effect of both features of the model is to reduce the value of workersâ€™ outside options, thereby reducing wages and worker mobility in equilibrium. I calibrate the model and evaluate its performance in generating key labor market moments for the US economy. Finally, I examine the model's central predictions using the public-use data from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD), Business Dynamics Statistics (BDS), and the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). I document that less competitive labor markets, characterized by a lower number of firms per worker, are associated with reduced measures of labor market dynamism and average wages.

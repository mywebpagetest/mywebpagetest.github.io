Hello, I am a fourth year PhD student in Economics at the University of Texas at Austin. My primary areas of interest are macroeconomics and labor economics. 

My current research focuses on understanding the consequences of firm market power on labor market outcomes in a search theoretic framework.

## Working Papers

* [**Incidence and Evolution of Nominal Wage Rigidity in the US**](https://sadhikabagga.github.io/BaggaSadhika_2019.pdf)

  This paper documents the change in nominal wage rigidity in the US using the 1996-00 and 2008-13 panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). Using the empirical methodology of Barattieri,  Basu  and  Gottschalk  (2014)   to correct for measurement errors in self-reported wages, this paper finds evidence of (i) an increase in the frequency of wage adjustment among hourly job-stayers over the two periods, and (ii) conditional on wage adjustments, a higher proportion of wage cuts during the Great Recession relative to the subsequent recovery. These findings are robust when the methodology is applied to salaried workers. They can be seen in light of increasing labor market flexibility in the US over the recent decades.
